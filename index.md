# Getting started with Orbit

Welcome to Orbit! 

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and launching your Orbit workspace.

## Part 1: Setting up your spreadsheet

The first thing you'll need to do is install our Google Sheets Add-On, which is how Orbit communicates with your Google Sheet. 

Install the add-on at [this link](http://bit.ly/orbitaddon). We recommend you use **Google Chrome**, but Safari or Firefox should also work well.

Once you install the add-on, an empty spreadsheet will open in a new tab and you'll be prompted to allow Orbit certain permissions related to your Google Account. Please refer to our [Terms of Conditions](avinalabs.com/legal) if you have questions relating how we use these permissions.

*If you get a warning about the app not being verified: click on Advanced option towards the bottom-left of the dialog and select Go to Orbit.*

When the app's installed, you should see the menu for Orbit appear in the Add-ons menu.

At this point, click on **"Reset to Template"** to import the Orbit template into this empty sheet. 

*While Orbit is in beta, you'll see a pop-up alert with a link to a Google Form. You'll need to fill this out to request early access. Make sure to include a link to the spreadsheet that you just created when you submit the Google Form! About 2-3 minutes after you submit the form, you should be able to proceed. Click on "Reset to Template" once again.*

If you see a "Welcome to Orbit" page, congratulations! You're ready to proceed. 



## Part 2: Configuring your workspace

At this point, you're ready to begin configuring your organization's workspace. We'll walk you through the different sheets – we strongly recommend you proceed in order!

As you proceed, look out for the light-gray blocks of text: these are examples that you can use for reference.



#### General

First, start by entering general information about your workspace. 

|                   |                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Organization Name | Berkeley SkyDeck |
| Mobile App Name   | SkyCentral       |
| Brand Color       | `#003262`        |

Next, add a few important links.

| Links             |                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Organization Icon | https://bit.ly/2ugwgVj                  |
| News Feed or Blog | https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/news/      |
| Social Media      | https://twitter.com/skydeck_cal?lang=en |

Make sure your organization icon is a direct link to an image; in other words, it should download immediately if you click on it. This is generally the format for images throughout.



#### Users

Orbit lets you customize your workspace to display different information to different categories of users. 

1. **User Type** – enter the category of users

2. **Login Type** – if you want to restrict access to your app to certain email addresses, you may do so by selecting Google Sign In and continue. To make a specific user type open to anyone, select *No Restriction* and skip to the next user type.

3. **Restriction Type** – you can either choose to restrict access to an approved list of users ("Restrict to List") or to users with emails in a particular domain ("Restrict to Domain").

   > If you choose "Restrict to List", use the Add-On menu to insert an "Approved User" sheet. On this sheet, you'll be able to paste a list of approved emails sorted by user category.

4. **Email Domain** – paste all approved email domains into this cell (comma-separated values)



## Part 3: Incorporating resources

#### A note about design

As you're bringing together resources for your organization, think about splitting your resources into two categories:

1. Items used on a day-to-day basis

   > Examples: campus maps, announcements, Google Forms, directories, toolkits

2. Resources used on a less-frequent basis (but still important to include)

   > Examples: tech support, HR paperwork, website links, general team information, miscellaneous resources

These two categories define the configuration of resources in Orbit. There's the **home page**, which contains the stuff your users need day-to-day, and there's the searchable **resources page**, which acts as a pseudo-mini Google Drive folder categorizing a bunch of different resources.
